# KILO .7 — Offline Autonomous Rover (ROS 2)

**STOP:** If `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` is missing or stale, do not build. Update it first.

This repo is designed to live on a removable flash drive and move between PCs.

## Repo spine
- `docs/PROJECT_CHARTER.md` — authoritative charter
- `docs/PROJECT_PATH.md` — guardrails and build order
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` — current status (single source of truth)
- `docs/DECISIONS_LEDGER.md` — append-only decisions log
- `docs/BUILD_HEADERS.md` — copy/paste build chat headers
- `docs/BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md` — how to use headers + session workflow
- `docs/LESSONS_LEARNED.md` — concise lessons/failure modes
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — what changed, versioned

## Layout
- `robot/` — ROS 2 packages (to be added)
- `phone/` — phone app notes/integration contracts (code can live elsewhere)
- `tools/` — scripts for snapshots, status dumps, log capture, etc.

## Flash-drive notes
See `docs/FLASH_DRIVE_SETUP.md`.
