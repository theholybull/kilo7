Title: UI truth FAIL — “Locked implies emotion from control”
Date: 2026-01-27
Scope: UI derivation rules/tests only (no backend changes)
Problem: 2/3 PASS; 1 FAIL indicates mapping not strictly derived from safety/control truth per docs.
Acceptance: Align mapping + test to docs (derive emotion/lockout strictly from safety/control: gate safe_to_move/reason, control locked/locked_reason/applied.throttle, relay status).
