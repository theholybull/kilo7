Title: Step 1.6 invariant FAIL due to subscriber count (single publisher confirmed)
Date: 2026-01-27
Scope: Tests only (no backend changes)
Problem: Invariants script flags FAIL citing multiple subscriptions despite 1 publisher on safety/control truth topics.
Risk: False negatives; obscures real publisher violations; wasted effort.
Acceptance: Update test to assert publisher count==1 and ignore subscriber count; add regression case.
