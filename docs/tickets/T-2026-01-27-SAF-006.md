Title: Phase 4 Prep — Speed-Aware Safety Model (Contracts + Tests Only)
Date: 2026-01-27
Status: Proposed

Scope
- Define additive contracts and acceptance checks for speed-aware safety profiles (crawl/normal/sport).
- Add test harnesses (no backend code changes yet) to validate stop distance scaling and reaction buffer calculations.
- Preserve single motion authority; do not introduce new arbiters.

Contracts (additive)
- `kilo/state/safety_model` (reserved): publish computed stop buffer metrics and profile selection (read-only truth).
- Fields (proposed): `profile`, `reaction_time_ms`, `brake_distance_m`, `stop_buffer_m`, `velocity_mps`.
- Consumers must treat this as observability only; Safety Gate remains the only deny authority.

Acceptance Checks (tests)
- Given velocity inputs and selected profile, computed `stop_buffer_m` scales appropriately.
- Safety Gate deny reasons remain stable and precedence unchanged.
- Control clamps throttle=0.0 when deny; safety model truth optional and does not affect enforcement.

Artifacts
- `robot/test_phase4_safety_model.py` (proposed): unit-level checks for calculation functions.
- Logs folder: `logs/phase_4/` for soak runs (when implemented).

Notes
- Implementation deferred until Phase 4 gate opens per BUILD_PLAN.
- This ticket is for contracts/tests only to reduce risk.
